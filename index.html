        <p>
            Come back to where I left long time ago when I was around 15 yo.
            Now I am 31 and I'm still a lot confused about life.
            I graduated in mathematics last month and now I don't know what to do with my working life.
            Today during a late evening walk I decided to build day by day this website in order to learn by doing how to code.
            I hope this will give a direction in my life and lower the feeling of being overwhelmed.
            I also have the need to tell about myself and I want it to be public, I don't realize why I have this urge right now but maybe I'll understand it along the way.
            A lot of talk, let's try out some HTML!
