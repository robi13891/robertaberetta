            Born in Milan on August 13th, 1991, I had a passion for Nintendo's Pokemon games as a child and dreamed of becoming a programmer to create my own. 
              At 14, I took my first steps towards that goal by learning HTML and CSS, but I quickly realized that frustration came hand in hand with the process. <br><br>
              However, that didn't stop me from pursuing my passions in other ways. 
              In 2006, YouTube entered my life and I became intrigued by the world of content creation, passively watching and learning as much as I could. <br><br>
              After earning my degree in Mathematics in 2022, I set out on a freelance journey as a math and physics tutor.
              It was during this time that I was first introduced to NFTs and became fascinated with the world of Web3 and distributed ledger technologies. 
              I've been immersing myself in these fields ever since, participating in events and continually educating myself on the latest advancements. <br><br>
              My journey may have taken a different path than I initially envisioned, but I am grateful for where it has led me. <br><br>
              So, there you have it - my journey from a Pokemon-loving kid to a tech-savvy and YouTube content creator. 
              Fueled by my passion for learning and determination to succeed, I am confident that my background in mathematics will be a valuable asset as I continue to explore and grow.
