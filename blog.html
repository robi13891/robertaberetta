            Today is my dad birthday. He always provided me all the money I nedeed to live. <br>
            I'll always be grateful for that but there's one problem. <br>
            This dynamic do not creates in me the need to work and the need to make my own money because I had money to buy whatever I wanted.
            I'm not saying I am rich af and I always try to save money instead of spending.
            I never spent a lot of money for clothes, shoes, smartphones, stuff but when seldomely I nedeed something I could afford it. <br>
            I'm trying to fix it earning my own money by private math lessons (I'm graduated in math) and hopefully by web development.

            Come back to where I left long time ago when I was around 15 yo.
            Now I am 31 and I'm still a lot confused about life.
            I graduated in mathematics last month and now I don't know what to do with my working life.
            Today during a late evening walk I decided to build day by day this website in order to learn by doing how to code.
            I hope this will give a direction in my life and lower the feeling of being overwhelmed.
            I also have the need to tell about myself and I want it to be public, I don't realize why I have this urge right now but maybe I'll understand it along the way.
            A lot of talk, let's try out some HTML!
